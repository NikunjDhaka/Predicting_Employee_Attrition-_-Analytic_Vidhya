We downloaded the dataset from Analystics Vidhya

We made Notebook file and also in the code itself we made prediction file in CSV format.

we performed major all the techniques in the data science project here :
1. Load dataset
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Preare Data for Machine Learning Model - (Data Preprocessing (Data cleaning, Feature Engineering, Outliers removal), Categorical Variable Encoding, Split dataset, Feature scaling)
4. Machine Learning Model Training
5. Test and Save predictions


PreRequirements to run this project: -
